    <h1>Interested to work at <a href="https://squareup.com/careers">Square</a>?</h1>
    <p>
      I am an engineer on the infosec team. If you are interested in any aspect
      of computer security (from hardware/low level stuff to backend infrastructure,
      writing secure web application or working on Android/iOS) you should
      really consider talking to our team!
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working at Square. I'm helping people grow their businesses.
      More important for me, I find my peers to be very altruistic: you can walk up to any engineer and ask them questions or schedule a pair-programming session with them,
      bounce ideas off each other, etc. I have never seen this kind of healthy
      engineering culture at any other tech company, we have something special going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Square has a strong open source culture and the infosec team has contributed
      several projects over the years. For example:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/square/keywhiz">keywhiz</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/square/go-jose">go-jose</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/square/js-jose">js-jose</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/square/ghostunnel">ghostunnel</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Drop me <a href="../contact_me.html">an email</a> if you are interested!
    </p>
    <p>P.S.
