    <p>
      Intuitively, many people think that you cannot have an electronic
      voting scheme which is auditable (i.e. everyone can count the votes)
      while preserving privacy (i.e. each individual vote is secret).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum">David Chaum</a> solved this problem more than 30 years ago using
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature">blind signature</a>.
      His solution can however be difficult to understand as it involves
      mathematics and cryptography.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have come up with a much simpler scheme to show that these two
      properties are not mutually exclusive. If you want to actually
      implement such a scheme, you probably want to read David Chaum's work.

      Credits to Manish Jethani and Shaanan Cohney for helping me put all
      this together.

  <h3>A few assumptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We have N people who want to cast a vote on a given matter, e.g.
      "which color should we paint the bike shed?".
    </li>
    <li>
      Every user has a public-private key pair, which can be used to
      digitally sign messages. I'm going to skip the process to acquire
      these keys and how the trust is established.
    </li>
    <li>
      The communication medium is a public forum, e.g. an irc channel or
      web application. The scheme can be adapted for peer-to-peer networks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Everyone is communicating annonymously using a technology like tor.
      The scheme can be adapted to not require tor.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Two phase scheme</h3>
  <p>
    The voting process involves two phases.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        In the first phase, everyone chooses a random number and casts a vote of
        the form <code>(random_number, vote)</code>. E.g.
        <code>(1912, blue)</code>, <code>(7821, red)</code>, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once exactly N votes have been cast, everyone checks that the votes
        contains their unique <code>(random number, vote)</code> pair and sends
        <code>signed(privkey, [vote1, vote2, ..., voteN])</code>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    After N people have signed the votes, the process is over.
    Everyone has confirmed that their vote was included, everyone can
    compute the outcome of the vote and nobody reveals their individual
    vote.
  </p>
  <p>
    If somebody votes more than once, either the number of signatures will
    not match up or there will be more than N votes, in which case the
    process ends without any result.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that this very simple scheme has a caveat: any participant
    can "jam" the system by continuously casting multiple votes. This
    is similar to the issue discussed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_cryptographers_problem">dining
    cryptographers problem</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Other approaches</h3>
  <p>
    Besides this simple scheme, it is possible to leverage blinding
    signatures, polynomial computation or homomorphic cryptography
    to achieve the same properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll let Shaanan write up his solution.
