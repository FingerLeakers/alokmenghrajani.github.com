<div class="lead">
  <p>Seven cryptographers would like to exchange presents with each other. They
  are geographically located in different places, so they can't use a
  traditional white elephant scheme (everyone brings a wrapped gift and puts it
  on a table, people then draw names and take turn picking a gift).
  </p>
  <p>Can you figure out a cryptographically equivalent scheme?</p>
</div>
<p>Specifically, design a distributed algorithm where:
  <ul>
  <li>Each cryptographer has a public/private key pair.</li>
  <li>Each cryptographer knows the public key of the other six participants.</li>
  <li>The algorithm results in every cryptographer knowing who they need
  to get a present for (so they can tailor it) but not knowing who is getting
  them a present (so there's a surprise factor).</li>
  </ul>

<p>Happy holidays! I will post a solution here in a few weeks...</p>
