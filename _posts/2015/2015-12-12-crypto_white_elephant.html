<div class="lead">
  <p>Seven cryptographers would like to exchange presents with each other. They
  are geographically located in different places, so they can't use a
  traditional white elephant scheme (everyone brings a wrapped gift and puts it
  on a table, people then draw names and take turn picking a gift).
  </p>
  <p>Can you figure out a cryptographically equivalent scheme?</p>
</div>
<p>Specifically, design a distributed algorithm where:
  <ul>
    <li>The algorithm results in every cryptographer knowing who they need
    to get a present for (they can tailor their presents) but not knowing who is
    getting them a present (there's a surprise factor).</li>
    <li>Each cryptographer has a public/private key pair.</li>
    <li>Each cryptographer knows the public key of the other six participants,
    as well as their address (so they can mail the presents).</li>
  </ul>

<pre id="solution" style="display: none">
Every cryptographer starts with:
- priv_key (their private key)
- pub_key (their prublic key)
- pub_keys (the set of all the 7 cryptographer's keys)

And follows the following 5 steps:

1. Takes the set of public keys (including their own) and generate a token1:
   token1 = sort(pub_keys).join('-');

2. Joins an irc channel named #token1, using tor to hide their identity.

3. Creates a temporary private/public key pair (temp_priv_key, temp_pub_key) and
   publishes the public part:
   - 1st message:
     send(temp_pub_key)

   The crytographers then wait for everyone else to publish their temporary
   public key and stores the set (including their own) in temp_pub_keys.

4. Computes sorted_temp_pub_keys = sort(temp_pub_keys) and
   token2 = sorted_temo_pub_keys.join('-'). Signs and sends token2 with their
   public key. (It's a way of saying "I have participated in round 3" without
   revealing their identity):
   - 2nd message:
     send(sign(msg=token2, key=priv_key))

   The cryptographers then wait for everyone else to publish their second
   message and validates that everyone has signed the same token2.

5. Reveals their identify to the person whose temporary public key comes right
   after theirs in token2.

   To do this, they publish their identify and a proof that they own the
   temporary private key:
     m = [sign(msg=token1, key=priv_key), sign(msg=token1, key=temp_priv_key)]
     next_key = (sorted_temp_pub_keys.indexOf(temp_pub_key) + 1) % 7;
     send(encrypt(msg=m, key=sorted_temp_pub_keys[next_key]))

   The cryptographers will be able to decrypt one message each. They must
   validate that the two signatures are correct and match the expected
   temporary key.

   Only the identity of the person they need to send a gift to is revealed.

Note:
Some interesting attacks to think of include: what happens if an evil
participant submits multiple temporary keys at step 3? What happens if a
participant is able to split the network in two halves?
