<p>
  The intersection of three cylinders (and six half-cylinders) are interesting
  objects and make for fun random desk objects. They are also fun to build out
  of wood (takes some time) or 3D print (mostly trivial).
</p>
<p>
  The intersection of three cylinder at a right angle results in a
  Steinmetz solid. Calculating the volume of the intersection is a classic
  math puzzle.

<p>I made a virtual 3d model that you can interact with in <a href="http://openjscad.org/#http://quaxio.com/files/2015/three_cylinders/three_cylinders.jscad">openjscad</a>.</p>

<p>
  The intersection of six cylinders results in a cube, which can seem counter
  intuitive at first given that cylinders are curved objects.
