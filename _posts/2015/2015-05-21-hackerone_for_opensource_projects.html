    It is common for companies to have a bug bounty program which rewards
    researchers who find and disclose security issues. One popular
    platform for hosting bug bounty programs is
    <a href="http://hackerone.com/">hackerone.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Companies are however reluctant to include their open source code
    in these programs. At Square, we came up with a solution.

  <h3>Why care about open source projects?</h3>
  <p>There are a few reasons why I wanted us to include our open source
    projects in our bounty program. Some of this code is used in our
    core infrastructure, we are therefore interested to know about any
    security issue which might affect our customers' security.</p>
  <p>I also feel that most current bug bounty programs target web
    security researchers and exclude people who have other skills
    (such as backend or static analysis skills). Our open source
    projects provide a way for security engineers with strong
    abilities in C, Java, Go, etc. to make meaningful contributions.</p>

  <h3>Some concerns companies have with bounty programs.</h3>
  <p>It seems companies are concerned that being able to report bugs in
    publicly accessible source code will make them waste time and money.
    They are concerned that they will have to deal with reports
    about theoritical flaws which cannot be exploited in practice.
  </p>
  <p>Being able to see the source code implies being able to see some
    of the design decisions the authors made. Design improvements
    are sometimes deemed not worth fixing if it implies a breaking
    API change.
  </p>
  <p>To summarize, being able to see the source code can lead researchers
    to miss the overall picture, which is taken into account when a decision
    is made to fix or not to fix a given bug.

  <h3>Square's bug bounty program.</h3>
  <p>
    At Square, we decided to launch a bug bounty program which covers
    some of the code published at
    <a href="https://github.com/square/">github.com/square</a>.
    The open source bug bounty program is separate from the <a href="https://hackerone.com/square">existing bounty</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rules for the two bounty programs are quite different. For example,
    our open source bounty requires people to submit a proof-of-concept or
    demonstrate a clear path to exploitation.
  </p>

    You can read more about this effort in our
    <a href="https://corner.squareup.com/2015/05/open-source-bug-bounty.html">blog post</a>.
