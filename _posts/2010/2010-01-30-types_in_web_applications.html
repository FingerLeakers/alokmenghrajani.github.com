<p>I poked at a web application looking for SQL injection and
cross site scripting bugs. This was part of a white box security testing of
a pretty large codebase.</p>
<p>At one point, I found a common coding pattern which I knew would result in
a security hole. For a second, I thought that I had stumbled upon dozens of
SQL injections!</p>

<p>It turned out that while I had theoretically found a whole bunch of flaws,
none of them were exploitable in practice. The reason is because the first thing
that the web application did with these user inputs was to cast them to an
integer. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your point of view), you
can't do much damage using only numbers.</p>

<p>While the casting to an integer had been put in place for documentation and
ease of development purpose, it turned out to also provide a layer of
security. I think types in general provide goodness at various layers and this
is only one such example.</p>

<p>A few months later, the code was re-written to use a better library to
manipulate SQL, which removed the risk of SQL injections.</p>
