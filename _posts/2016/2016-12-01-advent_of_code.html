    Every year (since last year) Eric Wastl organizes a programming contest. The contest runs
    from December 1st to December 25th and each day a puzzle is revealed at midnight UTC.

    Some people compete for speed. I decided to use this as an opportunity to learn a new
    programming language and picked <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>.

    Rust is a system's language which is designed with interesting safety properties. The memory model doesn't
    use a garbage collector or reference counting scheme, but instead leverages a borrow system which reminds me
    of <a href="https://github.com/pikatchu/LinearML/blob/b1a49f153e02f3cffb32784f2eeb7fca017b2791/README">LinearML</a>.

    In theory, such a system is more efficient as the number of cores on our processor grows. Let's see how this plays
    out in the long term?
