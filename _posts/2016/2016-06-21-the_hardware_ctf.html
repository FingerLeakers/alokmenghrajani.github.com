    A little puzzle I designed for Square's 2016 CTF. I was inspired by
    <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-badge.html">DefCon's
    badge</a> puzzles (my variant should however be significantly easier to solve).

  <ul>
    <li>The board is lead-free. It was printed thru <a href="https://oshpark.com/">Oshpark</a>.</li>
    <li>The components were choosen to be RoHS compliant, lead free. They were
      purchased on <a href="https://www.digikey.com">Digikey</a></li>

      lead. Keep out of reach from children.</li>
