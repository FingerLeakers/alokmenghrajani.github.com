<p>This semester, I'm TA-ing 2nd year computer science students. My main responsability
is to help the students with their assignments.</p>

<p>I think TA-ing is a great experience and I'm getting a lot out of it.</p>

<p>One thing I struggle with is that I find coding has become an intuitive process for me and
it's not always easy to explain my thought process using words.</p>

<p>I try to give examples and repeat what the professor thaught using my own words, but I
sometimes get back blank stares in response. Sometimes, I end up giving a simplified
theory to hid some of the complexity. I hope the students don't feel that I'm lying to them?</p>

<p>I found grading to be frustrating. It's hard to strike the balance between being
an easy and harsh grader.</p>
