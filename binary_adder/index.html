    <h1>Binary Adder</h1>
    <p>This was a high school physics project. I was a student at Chamblandes, Pully, Switzerland in 1999.</p>

    <p>
      I designed and built a binary adder which didn't use any transistors or semi-conductor. I instead used solid state relays,
      LEDs, switches and resistors. The idea was to built something similar to the early computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I designed this calculator, I didn't know the theory behind circuit design. I also didn't know how boolean algebra
      was linked to computing. I therefore designed this calculator by using intuition and a lot of trial and error (on paper). One of my main challenges was to
      reduce the number of relays needed, as these components consume a lot of energy and are expensive.
    </p>

        <p>On this picture, you can see the various components I used: 8 switches (top left), 3 relays (top right) and 13 LEDs and resistors.</p>

      The basics of any calculator lies in the ability to perform binary computations. Binary is a different way to represent numbers. Since
      we have ten fingers, we count in a decimal system. We count from 0 to 9 and then start again from 10 to 19. We count by groups of tens.
      25 is two groups of ten and 5 groups of one. Unfortunately computers can't calculate like this. They can only count by groups of twos,
      so 101 is one group of 4, zero groups of 2 and one group of 1, which sums to 5.

        <p>The adder is controlled by these 8 switches. Each switch controls a power of two.</p>

      To do the basic binary calculations, I used relays. These are like switches, but instead of being controlled
      mechanically like a keyboard, they are controlled by an electric current.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the current flows through them, they close (due to electromagnetic interaction). When the current stops to flow,
      they open (due to a spring). You can see the three relays on the picture above (up on the right).

      The first part of the project involved drawing the circuits on a sheet of paper. This was interesting
      because I didn't know how many relays I would need; my first design required eight of them. I then reduced the number to three.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then ordered the components and soldered them together. The major difficulty I encountered was working with all the wires.
      I used a piece of Balsa wood, which was soft and easy to work with. I remember, it was fun hearing the relays click
      whenever the inputs to the adder changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: I had to use the power supply from a Commodore 64 (9V, 1A) because of the power consumption of the relays.
