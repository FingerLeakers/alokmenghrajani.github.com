      A random list of web or software technology which came and went. Feel free to suggest things
      I missed or suggest changes to any mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm including links to the wikipedia articles, as I'm unsure how long the
      official sites will continue to live. Some of the wikipedia article also
      include screenshots, so worth checking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many thanks to my friends who helped me put this list together!

    they were officially disconnected.</p>

    <h3>The Palace <small>(1995-2001)</small></h3>
    <p>
      A very popular graphical chat application. Users could chat in "rooms". I believe you had to
      spend some money to get the ability to customize your room.

    <h3>Napster <small>(1999-2001)</small></h3>
    <p>
      The first P2P file sharing software which really became popular. The network was mostly focused around
      mp3 music and was shutdown due to the amount of copyrighted material users were exchanging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napster's architecture was built around centralized index servers. This was not the case of the various
      services which later replaced it.

    <h3>The Million Dollar Homepage <small>(2005-2006)</small></h3>
    <p>
      The million dollar homepage was a blank page where the author sold each pixel for $1.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last pixels were auctioned on eBay and the page generated $1,037,100. The site is still up to this
      date. Many people copied this very simple advertising idea.

    <h3>Geocities <small>(1994-2009)</small></h3>
    <p>
      Geocities was one the most popular web hosting platform. Sites were grouped by "neighborhood", to make it easier
      to browser and find content related to user's interests. Back then, there were no search engines to index the
      web!
    </p>
    <p>
      Geocities was acquired by Yahoo! in 1999.

    <h3>ICQ <small>(1996-2010)</small></h3>
    <p>
      ICQ was a very popular chat client. It was one of the first clients to transparently support offline and
      online chat. It also played very distinctive sounds, whenever a friend came online or sent a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service is still running, but I think its popularity peaked between 2000-2005.

    <h3>Minitel <small>(1978-2012)</small></h3>
    <p>
      The Minitel was a popular online service in France. The technology was similar in some ways
      to the web: clients would dial-in to services to look-up phone numbers or time tables. Users
      paid by the minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In USA, a similar online service was BBS, which was popular around the same time as the French Minitel.
