  <h1>Puzzle 3</h1>
  <h2>Some info</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Feel free to abuse the hardware; it's yours. Each team only gets one hardware, so don't brick it!</li>
    <li>The board is easy to power from a wide range of sources. Don't go over ~35V. Some components might heat up a little.</li>
    <li>Solving the puzzle may require using sharp or hot tools (knives, soldering iron, etc.). Handle your tools carefully.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hazardous substances</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The board is lead-free. It was printed thru Oshpark.</li>
    <li>The components were choosen to be RoHS compliant, lead free. They were purchased on Digikey.</li>
    <li>I used a variety of different solder. Unfortunately, most solder contains lead. Keep out of the reach of children.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Credits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>andyl@, tritov@, jkelly@ and mmc@ helped me go from prototype to a finished board; answering various questions along the way</li>
    <li>Bad soldering job by cs@ and cdenny@.</li>
  </ul>

  Enjoy!
