          It is common for companies to have a bug bounty program which rewards
          researchers who find and disclose security issues. One popular
          platform for hosting bug bounty programs is
          <a href="http://hackerone.com/" class="external">hackerone.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Companies are however reluctant to include their open source code
          in these programs. At Square, we came up with a solution.

      <h3>Why care about open source projects?</h3>
      <p>There are a few reasons why I wanted us to include our open source
        projects in our bounty program. Some of this code is used in our
        core infrastructure, we are therefore interested to know about any
        security issue which might affect our customers' security.</p>
      <p>I also feel that most current bug bounty programs target web
        security researchers and exclude people who have other skills
        (such as backend or static analysis skills). Our open source
        projects provide a way for security engineers with strong
        abilities in C, Java, Go, etc. to make meaningful contributions.</p>

      <h3>Some concerns companies have with bounty programs.</h3>
      <p>It seems companies are concerned that being able to report bugs in
        publicly accessible source code will make them waste time and money.
        They are concerned that they will have to deal with reports
        about theoritical flaws which cannot be exploited in practice.
      </p>
      <p>Being able to see the source code implies being able to see some
        of the design decisions the authors made. Design improvements
        are sometimes deemed not worth fixing if it implies a breaking
        API change.
      </p>
      <p>To summarize, being able to see the source code can lead researchers
        to miss the overall picture, which is taken into account when a decision
        is made to fix or not to fix a given bug.

      <h3>Square's bug bounty program.</h3>
      <p>
        At Square, we decided to launch a bug bounty program which covers
        some of the code published at
        <a href="https://github.com/square/" class="external">github.com/square</a>.
        The open source bug bounty program is separate from the <a href="https://hackerone.com/square" class="external">existing bounty</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules for the two bounty programs are quite different. For example,
        our open source bounty requires people to submit a proof-of-concept or
        demonstrate a clear path to exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read more about this effort in our
        <a href="https://corner.squareup.com/2015/05/open-source-bug-bounty.html" class="external">blog post</a>.
