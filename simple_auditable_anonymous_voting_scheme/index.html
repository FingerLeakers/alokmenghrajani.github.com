      <h1>A simple auditable &amp; anonymous voting scheme</h1>
      <div class="lead">
        <p>
          Intuitively, many people think that you cannot have an electronic
          voting scheme which is auditable (i.e. everyone can count the votes)
          while preserving privacy (i.e. each individual vote is secret).
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum" class="external">David Chaum</a> solved this problem more than 30 years ago using
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature" class="external">blind signature</a>.
          His solution can however be difficult to understand as it involves
          mathematics and cryptography.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have come up with a much simpler scheme to show that these two
          properties are not mutually exclusive. If you want to actually
          implement such a scheme, you probably want to read David Chaum's work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Credits to Manish Jethani and Shaanan Cohney for helping me put all
          this together.

      <h3>A few assumptions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We have N people who want to cast a vote on a given matter, e.g.
          "which color should we paint the bike shed?".
        </li>
        <li>
          Every user has a public-private key pair, which can be used to
          digitally sign messages. I'm going to skip the process to acquire
          these keys and how the trust is established.
        </li>
        <li>
          The communication medium is a public forum, e.g. an irc channel or
          web application. The scheme can be adapted for peer-to-peer networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone is communicating annonymously using a technology like tor.
          The scheme can be adapted to not require tor.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Two phase scheme</h3>
      <p>
        The voting process involves two phases.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the first phase, everyone chooses a random number and casts a vote of
            the form <code>(random_number, vote)</code>. E.g.
            <code>(1912, blue)</code>, <code>(7821, red)</code>, etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once exactly N votes have been cast, everyone checks that the votes
            contains their unique <code>(random number, vote)</code> pair and sends
            <code>signed(privkey, [vote1, vote2, ..., voteN])</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After N people have signed the votes, the process is over.
        Everyone has confirmed that their vote was included, everyone can
        compute the outcome of the vote and nobody reveals their individual
        vote.
      </p>
      <p>
        If somebody votes more than once, either the number of signatures will
        not match up or there will be more than N votes, in which case the
        process ends without any result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that this very simple scheme has a caveat: any participant
        can "jam" the system by continuously casting multiple votes. This
        is similar to the issue discussed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_cryptographers_problem" class="external">dining
        cryptographers problem</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Other approaches</h3>
      <p>
        Besides this simple scheme, it is possible to leverage blinding
        signatures, polynomial computation or homomorphic cryptography
        to achieve the same properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll let Shaanan write up his solution.
