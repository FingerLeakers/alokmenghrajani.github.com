      <h1>Some math puzzles</h1>
      <div class="lead">
        <p>
          Over the years, I have collected a bunch of math puzzles. This page
          contains a few of them with hints or solutions in some cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you enjoy these puzzles, you should checkout IBM's
          <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/" class="external">ponder this</a>,
          a page were you get to solve a fun math puzzle every month since
          1998. If you email the correct solution they'll add your name
          to the list of people who have answered correctly.

      <h3>Four corners</h3>
      <p>
        There are four towns at the corners of a perfect square with a side of
        1. Your task is to connect these towns through a railroad such that all
        the four towns are connected and the length of the railroad is the
        smallest.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, if you connect all the four sides of the square, then the
        length of the railroad is 4. If you connect any three sides, all the
        four towns are still connected, and the length is 3. Can you do better?
      </p>
      <a onclick="$(event.target).hide();$('#cornershint').fadeIn()">(hint)</a>
      <p id="cornershint" style="display: none;">you can do better than 2 sqrt(2).</p>

      <h3>Two ropes</h3>
      <p>
        We have two ropes made of non-homogeneous material. Each rope takes
        eactly one hour to burn.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can you measure 45 minutes?
      </p>
      <a onclick="$(event.target).hide();$('#tworopeshint').fadeIn()">(hint)</a>
      <p id="tworopeshint" style="display: none;">you can't cut a rope in 3/4
        and burn it as the ropes are nothomogeneous. Instead, can you think of a way to burn the rope twice
        as fast?</p>

      <h3>The traveling bee</h3>
      <p>
        Two trains are travelling towards each other at speeds of 30 km/h and
        20mk/h. When they are 50 km apart, a bee starts flying from one train
        to the other at an astoundishing speed of 50 km/h. When the bee reaches
        the other train, it turns around and heads back towards the first train.
        Then it turns around again, etc. until the trains meet.
      </p>
      <p>What is the total distance covered by the bee?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Ages of the three daughters</h3>
      <p>Two friends meet after a long time. The first one says "I now have
        3 daughters". The second one asks their age.</p>
      <p>First person: The product of their ages is 36.</p>
      <p>Second person: I need some more information.</p>
      <p>First person: The sum of their ages is the same as the number of that
        house.</p>
      <p>Second person: I still can't calculate their ages.</p>
      <p>First person: Ah right, the eldest is blonde.</p>
      <p>Second person: I now know their ages.</p>
      <p>How old are the three girls?</p>
    </section>

      <h3>Next number in the series</h3>
      <p>What is the next number in this series?</p>
<pre>1
11
21
1211
111221
312211
13112221</pre>
      <a onclick="$(event.target).hide();$('#nextnumsolution').fadeIn()">(solution)</a>
      <p id="nextnumsolution" style="display: none;">each number "describes" the previous one. The next
           one is 1113213211.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>The farmers</h3>
      <p>Two farmers share a cow herd. One day, they sell their cows and get as
        many dollars per cow as the total number of cows they sold.</p>
      <p>With this money, they buy some sheeps. They pay 10 dollars per sheep,
        and they buy a lamb with the remaining money.</p>
      <p>One of the farmers gets the lamb, and the other one gets an extra
        sheep. The one who gets the sheep must also pay some money to his
        friend.</p>
      <p>How much money does he need to pay in order for the trade to be fair?
        (assuming the amount is an integer)</p>
      <a onclick="$(event.target).hide();$('#farmershint').fadeIn()">(hint)</a>
      <p id="farmershint" style="display: none;">the solution is unique</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Water jugs</h3>
      <p>You have got two jugs. The first one has got a capacity of 5L and the
        second one has got a capacity of 7L.</p>
      <p>You also have some water, and you want to mesure exactly 3L. How can
      you do that? What other amounts can you measure?</p>
      <a onclick="$(event.target).hide();$('#waterjugshunt').fadeIn()">(hint)</a>
      <p id="waterjugshunt" style="display: none;">if the two jugs are co-prime
        you can measure all the numbers from 1 to sum of both numbers</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Weighing scale</h3>
      <p>A merchant has a balance scale and a 40kg stone. He trades his stone
        against four smaller ones, which all sum up to 40kg. Using only these
        four smaller stones, he is now able to weigh any item from 1kg to 40kg.
      </p>
      <p>What are the weights of these four stones?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>The lift</h3>
      <p>A 30 year old man lives on the 25th floor of a building. Every morning
        he uses the lift to get to the ground floor and goes to work. When he
        gets back, he takes the lift up to the 24th floor and then walks his
        way up the last floor. He has this strange habit of walking the last
        floor every day, except when it has been a rainy day, in which case he
        takes the lift straight up to the last floor.
      </p>
      <p>Can you explain this man's strange behavior?</p>
      <a onclick="$(event.target).hide();$('#liftsolution').fadeIn()">(solution)</a>
      <p id="liftsolution" style="display: none;">The man is too short to push
        the 25th floor button. On rainy days, he is able to use his umbrella.</p>
