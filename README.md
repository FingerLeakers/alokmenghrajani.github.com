Alok Menghrajani's Blog

I started this blog around 1996, hosting it on geocities.com at first. What started as a small collection of random
posts about chess and computers graphics grew into a collection of around 100 posts covering a wide array of computer
science topics: from quines to size optimization. From web security to compilers/language design. And many other topics.

After hosting this site for over 20 years and serving several million page views, I have decided to no longer post new
content. I hope you'll enjoy all the content, which can still be accessed at [quaxio.com](https://quaxio.com/).
