<p>jQuery has this quirk, where you can't pass user data to the $() function:</p>
<pre>
$('&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;')
</pre>

<p>The $() code ends up creating an HTML node, which can lead to a XSS hole.</p>

<p>This vector for bugs has been known for a while (<a href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521">bug 9521</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11617">bug 11617</a>), but can unfortunately still be exploited in some cases.</p>

<p>edit: this bug bites cryptocat, https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/issues/613</p>
