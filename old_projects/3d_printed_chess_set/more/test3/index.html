<h1>3d printed chess set</h1>
<p>
  This page documents my adventure 3d printing a chess set from scratch. I
  used javascript + the browser for all the steps of the process.
</p>
<p>
  I started by building a library to manipulate bezier curves. I then created a
  three dimensional toolbox which allowed me to combine bezier curves to create
  objects. My idea was to treat curves as functions, and use inspiration by
  lighttable/bret victor and https://github.com/damelang/nile.

<p>
  Finally, I implemented CSG and tesselation to generate the final file for
  3d printing.

  Overview
3d printing a chess set from scratch. I created a bezier curve editor,
a 3d modeller, CSG operations and a mesh generator (all in JavaScript).
I then took the resulting files and 3d printed them.

I wanted to model the chess set by using a combination of bezier curves and
math functions. At some point, I figured a bezier curve is just a way to
visually represent and manipulate a math function of the form f(x). I then
built a modeling framework where transformations on properties (e.g. object
width or rotation) could be described either using math functions or bezier
curves.

If you think about it, it's a generalization of the bowl/rotation.
