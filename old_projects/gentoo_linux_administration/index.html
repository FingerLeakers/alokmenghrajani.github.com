<div class="descr">Feb 2007</div>
<p>I was asked to teach gentoo linux administration to users who had some experience with other UNIX systems, but nearly no knowledge of the linux world. I therefore prepared an overview of the most important commands for their day-to-day jobs, knowing that they would easily be able to find and understand any advanced information by reading man pages.</p>

<p>The course covered the following topics:</p>
<p>overview of the filesystem layout, basic and advanced linux commands, regular expressions, logging (syslog and snmp), iptables, ipsec, keeping the system up-to-date.</p>
